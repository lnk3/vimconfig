# VIM CONFIGURATION FILE
I use Vim on Windows 10 with CMD, NOT USING WSL. 

## Windows 10 and VIM
To set up a version controlled vimrc file I added to the default ``_vimrc`` (located by default on ``C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\_vimrc``) this line:
```source C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\vimfiles\.config\_vimrc```
and I write and update all my vimrc settings in the custom file.
